    <h1>Hello Welcome to my page</h1>
    <h2>My name is Kasperi</h2>
    <p>
        I'm just a regular guy studying software development at Haaga-Helia University. <br>
        I've always had this thing for tech. So, I thought, why not make a career out of it?<br>

        My days are basically filled with coding, gaming and trying to improve in both. <br>
        It's not always a walk in the park, but I'm up for the challenge. <br>
